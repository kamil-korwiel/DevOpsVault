# ISO OSI
---
Model OSI  (full name: ISO OSI RM ang. ISO Open System Interconnection Reference Model ) or OSI - standard define by ISO and ITU-T is **describe structure of network communication** 
- Theoretical network model, through which manufacturers could develop network solutions.
- Model ISO OSI RM  is viewed as a reference model ( a template) for most families of communication protocols.
- The basic premise of this model is divide 7 layers that cooperate with each other in a well-defined way

#Fun-Fact  - The work at this model start in 70 and the standard was accepted 1984

## The OSI model vs the TCP/IP model
---
While the OSI model is comprehensive reference framework for general networking systems, it's important to mention that the modern Internet doesnâ€™t _strictly_ follow the OSI model.

The modern Internet more closely follows the simpler _Internet protocol suite_, which is commonly known as _TCP/IP_ because the foundational protocols in the suite are the _TCP_ (Transmission Control Protocol) and the _IP_ (Internet Protocol).

The following image illustrates how the OSI and TCP/IP models relate to each other:
